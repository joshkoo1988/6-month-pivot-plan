<h1>6 Month Career Pivot Plan</h1>

Description
This is pretty much a copy and paste of my person journey into tech. about 7 months ago I decided I was no longer happy in healthcare and wanted to pivot. I have always had a high affinity tech and have dabbled in scripting and programming so it seemed like a very organic segway for my career. With all that said Im sure as you all know Tech is not an easy field to breakinto as it once was. Unfortunalty with the breakthrough of AI as well as the oversaturation of 6 month bootcamps the tech indistry has been flooded with applicants and you need to do everything you can in order to stand out.

Keep in mind this will be a very intense 6 months if you follow along with me because it will contain lessons on full stack development with more emphasis on backend,Linux (get used to linux), as well as Cyber Security concepts and basic scripting.
